## 💻 getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` in your browser.

### Build

To build the static site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
1.  Run `npm run fetch-pubs` to update publication data from Researchmap.
2.  Generate static HTML files in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview

To preview the built site locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The site is configured to automatically deploy to **GitHub Pages** using GitHub Actions.

### Configuration
1.  Go to GitHub repository **Settings**.
2.  Navigate to **Pages** (under the "Code and automation" section).
3.  Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.

### Trigger
*   Any push to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment.
*   You can monitor the status in the **Actions** tab of your repository.

## �📝 Content Management

### Adding News
1.  Create a new Markdown file in `src/content/news/`.
2.  Use the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
3.  Ensure the frontmatter includes `title`, `date`, and `lang` (if applicable).

### Updating Members
1.  Edit `src/data/members.json`.
2.  Add new member objects following the existing structure (name, role, image, etc.).

### Updating Publications
The project includes a script to fetch publications from Researchmap.
-   **Automatic**: The `npm run build` command runs `src/scripts/fetch_researchmap.js` automatically.
-   **Manual**: You can manually run `npm run fetch-pubs` to update `src/data/publications.json` locally.
